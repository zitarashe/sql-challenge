This challenge is divided into three parts: Data Modelling, Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

Data Modelling

 In this step I inspected the CSV files, and then sketched na ERD of the tables 

Data Engineering

I created a table for each of the six  CSV files and out them in order to handle the foreign keys.

I made sure to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys , and other constraints.

For the primary keys, I verified that the column is unique.

Data Analysis

In this step I listed the following:
* Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee 
* First name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986 
* Manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name 
* Department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name
* Name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B 
* Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name 
* Each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
* The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)
